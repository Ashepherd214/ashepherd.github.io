			My name is Aaron Shepherd and I'm her for your technical needs.
			I am an Alumni of Oklahoma State with a Bachelors of Science in
			Electrical Engineering Technology. In the course of my university
			career I learned a couple of prominent programming languages such as 
			Java and C. Since graduating I have expanded on that knowledge by
			adding Web development languages such as CSS and React. I am also an
			App developer specializing in React Native to build apps
			for both Android and iOS at a quicker pace. Inquire below to schedule
			a consultation and see what I can do for you.
